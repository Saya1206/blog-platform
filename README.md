## CI/CD and Deployment

### GitHub Actions

This project uses GitHub Actions to automate the CI/CD pipeline. The steps for this pipeline are:

- **Install dependencies** on each push or pull request.
- **Run tests** (if available).
- **Build the app** and deploy it to GitHub Pages.

### Deployment to GitHub Pages

After a successful push to the `main` branch, GitHub Actions will automatically:

- Build the React app.
- Deploy the build folder to the `gh-pages` branch.

Once deployed, the blog platform will be accessible at:

```
https://<username>.github.io/blog-platform/
```
